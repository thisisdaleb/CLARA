Xsar: Hey, Sam, why so blue?
Sam: Well, I've been thinking, what if I had been stronger? Do you think Abe would have kept me on the team?
Xsar: Oh, come on, Sam! You know that Abe isn't like that! He loves us all! He wanted to keep us safe!
Xsar: So what if the voices told him to put us in the box? He didn't release us, and he even changed boxes afterwards!
Sam: But maybe if I had been stronger, the voices wouldn't have kicked me out...
Xsar: Sam, you can't keep looking at the past. You know Abe loved you, and still loves you, right?
Sam: Yeah, I know, I know...
Xsar: So you can't keep focusing on that type of stuff! You gotta remember the good days, while looking forward to what comes next!
Xsar: We gotta keep on cheering on Abe, just like we always have, and just like we always will!
Sam: ....Yeah, I think you're right.            Thanks, Xsar!
Xsar: Now let's go eat some Kanto Krispy Kremes, okay?
