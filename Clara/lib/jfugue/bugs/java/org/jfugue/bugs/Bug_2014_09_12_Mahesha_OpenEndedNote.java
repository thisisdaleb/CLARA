/**
 * Problem: A note like "Co-" isn't playing indefinitely. It never sounds unless it's followed by "C-o"
 * Solution: The example given was "I40 Co-". It turns out that the total duration of this pattern is only "o". More needs to be added
 * to the pattern to fill out the duration, and it can't just be rests - "trailing rests are like leading zeros, they just don't make a difference."
 * So, "I40 Co- Rwwww C-o" would work. Or, depending on the application, use the RealtimePlayer to play Co- without knowing when to play C-o.
