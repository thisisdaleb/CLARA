//The algorithm generates 3 tracks, these are V0, V1 and V2. V0 is the lead track, V1 are chords and V2 is the bass. The rhythm of V1 and V2 are exactly the same. First V1 and V2 are generated, and then V0 with the following method:
//
//1. Take the next note from V1
//2. Append notes to V0 until it fills the duration of the note taken from V1
//
//The software does this until it reaches the last note of V1, so the V0 track is complete. BUT: 
//
// - Somehow when I export it to a MIDI, and open it with any MIDI editor (example MuseScore or Cakewalk), the notes are much shorter than they're supposed to be, for example: Where should be a whole note, there is only an 8th, and so on.
// - And when playing the MIDI, V1 and V2 are together, but V0 is ahead of the other two tracks. (But they should be together at every note from V1 or V2).
//
//Do you have any idea what the problem should be?
//
//An example:
//
//This musicString geerates the attached midi sequence.
//
//MusicString (You can see that the next few durations from V0 always fills the next V1 duration if you sum up):
